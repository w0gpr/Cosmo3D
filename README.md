# Cosmo3D

A 3D cosmogenic nuclide production model through complex (i.e. non-infinite half space) to estimate nuclide concentrations at depth through a surface. The original project is to determine the profile of a plucked boulder based on collected samples from under the boulder outline, as observed in the field. Input data includes: Cosmogenic Nuclide sample information, and it could include a surface profile, but initially that is hard coded for my purposes. Outputs would include figures, and minimized profiles.
